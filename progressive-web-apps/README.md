## What are PWAs

- PWA's reduce data use, make apps fast and reliable, less storage space required
- Better on web and mobile, makes web apps seem native, good for downloading native apps on any device, device agnostic - users & customers to download the app on any device without app stores
- works on lower-speed networks and is an application that's like a mobile website.
- improves loading times across all environments and varying networks
- PWA's work on the principle of continous build and integration of the build files in the production environment not just the dev environment.
