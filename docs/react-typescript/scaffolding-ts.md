Plural Sight Course:
Building React Apps with TypeScript By Mat Warger

In the root folder I have scaffolded this project with

`npx create-react-app react-typescript --template typescript`

Note the `tsconfig` file
Node modules will now have the typescript files
File extensions are now `.tsx` not `.jsx`
