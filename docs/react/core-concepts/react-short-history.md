Plural Sight: React the Big Picture : Cory House

2011- Front-end JavaScript library created by Facebook for user interfaces.
2012 - Used on Instagram
2013 - It is maintained by Facebook and an open source developer community.
2014 - Used by many large companiesbecause it helps in scaling apps quickly and efficiently. React focuses on the developer experience. The key advantage of React is that it makes it easier for front-end developers to build rich user-interfaces without having to think about DOM manipulation, CSS-selectors, rendering and updating multiple pages as an application grows. As the underlying data that drives the pages change, the user interface is updated and changed automatically. This is done seamlessly under the hood with key React methods that have been written into the library.

2016 - React 15 released
2019 - React Hooks React 16.8
