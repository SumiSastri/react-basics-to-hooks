4. Lightweight and performant

- Uses the Virtual-DOM (see React interview questions) which is more performant. React minimises DOM use with the virtual-DOM.
- Performant apps save battery and CPU - this is very important for mobile devices where saving battery use is important
-  Bundle size - 35K when minified and Gzipped
- Smaller libraries exist - Inferno 9K/ Preact 3K/ 
- Migrating other frameworks/ languages to React can be done by injecting React as it does not force decisions on you
- Boiler plates like CRA make it easy to use
