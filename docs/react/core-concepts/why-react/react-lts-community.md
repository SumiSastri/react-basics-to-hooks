- FB/ WhatsApp/ Instagram are all built on React - high level of traffic
- Active blogs for release and plans for the future
- Breaking changes with CodeMod update
- React codemod script with every release this resolves breaking changes making all React libraries backward compatibile and ensures long term stability
- One of the most popular repos on GitHub, downloaded over 10-mil times a week
- Stack-share shows many large corporates use React and its growing ecosystem
- Reactiflux - online community
- Stack-overflow support
- They open source their components (google - Material UI)
- FB invests a lot in its developer community and does not rely on open source
- Most companies using React can not afford the dev-team that FB employs
- Although features are mainly based on FB needs but as an open-source platform there is a balance of power between FB and the communities
- React came with a patent clause but with React 16 this was removed it now uses the open source MIT licence
