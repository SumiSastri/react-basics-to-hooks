2. Developer Experience improved/ simplified with CRA

- Create an app in seconds with the pre-compiled CRA - create-react-app
- Rapid feedback
- Small logical API
- Easy to learn if you know JavaScript
- Few concepts to master
- Import the library with a Node import statement
- Create a function that returns JSX  -> which looks like HTML
- JSX compiles back to JavaScript
- The function takes an argument which is an object
- The object is called properties (not params) or props
(See functional component demo)
- Debugging is easy with the debugging tool installed by the CRA 
- Code Sandbox - easy to experiment with React and share work
