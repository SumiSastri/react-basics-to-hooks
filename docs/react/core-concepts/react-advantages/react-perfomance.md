Plural Sight: React the Big Picture : Cory House

**Lightweight and performant**

- Uses the Virtual-DOM (also see FAQs-interview questions) which is more performant. React minimises DOM use with the virtual-DOM. It helps avoid layout thrashing (or tree-shaking), which is when a browser has to recalculate the position of everything when a DOM element changes.
- As comparison happens in memory it is very fast making it a highly performant app. Performant apps save battery and CPU - this is very important for mobile devices where saving battery use is important
- Bundle size - 35K when minified and Gzipped
- Smaller libraries exist - Inferno 9K/ Preact 3K/
- Migrating other frameworks/ languages to React can be done by injecting React as it does not force decisions on you
- Boiler plates like CRA make it easy to use
