Plural Sight: React the Big Picture : Cory House

**Framework vs. Library**

The first tradeoff is framework versus library. Competitors like Angular and Ember are frameworks. React, in contrast, is generally considered a library since it's lean and focused on components. Now a framework isn't fundamentally better than a library. It's a tradeoff.

Here's a few advantages to choosing the framework approach. A framework contains more opinions, so you can avoid spending time trying to choose between many options. This reduces decision fatigue, and there's often less setup overhead. Frameworks can help enforce consistency since most frameworks are more opinionated.

However, React's Library approach also has some clear advantages. At only around 35K Gzipped, React is significantly smaller than most frameworks. This means that it's small enough that you can sprinkle it on existing applications so that you can slowly migrate an existing app to React, even a server‑side rendered app.

Imagine you have an existing app built in .NET, Java, Ruby, PHP, Python, whatever. Since React is small and flexible, you can replace a single component on the page with a React component. So you can use your React components anywhere because they're lightweight. This is precisely how Facebook slowly migrated from a server‑side rendered PHP application to React.

And React doesn't force many decisions on you. It allows you to only pull in the features that you need to keep your app lean and fast. You're free to pick the precise technologies that you need for your project, and you're free to select the best technology for your use case as well.

Decision fatigue is also largely a solved problem with React because opinionated boiler plates, like create‑react‑app, effectively turn React into an optional framework. Now since React is a focused component library, more comprehensive frameworks like Angular come bundled with more features, including testing, a library for HTTP calls, routing, and internationalization all built in. In contrast with React, you select the pieces that apply to your use case and you add them in. Since React is very popular, there's almost certainly a mature library that does what you need. Here's just a few of the most popular options for each use case. And the nice thing with React is your users don't have to waste time downloading and parsing features that they don't use. You can pull in only what you need from this list.
