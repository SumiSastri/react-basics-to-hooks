From Testing React Components - Plural Sight (Liam McLennan)

1. Does it conform with the design - as well as be clean and logical when designed
2. Verify the design created right result (does the code work)
3. Confidence in the application if the code is robust - checks code runs correctly with future updates in code base (new features/ refactoring/ new dependencies added to repo)
4. Helps understand current behaviour, modify it for future needs - a document for reference that captures the expected and verified behavior of the program. A form of documentation for future reference and new devs to the team
5. The design should not throw errors when compiled or interpreted (parsed) by a computer
6. Good training for developers - [attern of thinking produced by the testing process facilitates good design
7. Catches bugs and removes errors
8. Speed up QA (quality assurance) time - integrate into work-flow/ build complex test flow through the code release process
9. Automates iterative code development - long term more efficient
10. Make code modular that can be testable - makes you write better code
