Forms collect user data for legal and customer safety purposes, security is important to address.

Different parts of applications in the front-end and back-end handle security. And both front-end and back-end validations are important to reduce the risk of security attacks on web and mobile applications.

Malicious actors can either infilterate or manipulate data. They may use machine learning to gather information and maintain access and invest a significant amount in covering their tracks

Sensitive information that are stored in browsers can be stolen with both infilteration and manipulation techniques.

Malicious actors look at
- URLs - the query string, url fragments, the history object
- Storage APIs
- Cookies
- Application configurations
- Local storage
- Data caches
- HTTP network calls - referrer

to infilterate and manipulate information that they want to access.

The type of hack attacks are
[https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/ethical-hacking-cyber-security-tutorial/it-threats-and-attacks/]

- Virus (aim to damage systems by instering malicious code), Spyware (deceitful information gathering) & Worm (attack emails, file-sharing, instant messaging) injections
- Spyware
- Phishing (fraudulent emails, calls, texts)
- Spamware (spam message with the malicious intent to insert viruses, worms, spyware etc)/ Ransomware (encrypting of organisations data and then requesting ransom to unlock)
- Botnet - take control of the systems wihtout the users knowledge
- Cache poisoning - In this type of attack, your network system is compromised by manipulating your machine address. By converting your machine address into a local IP network, your computer proceeds with the connection to the address fixed by the other party.
This means that you might think that the connection is established to the site you chose, but in reality, the other party would have diverted the connection to a place where information can be collected easily. Since the new connection is deceivingly similar to the one chosen by you, it might take a while to find the difference.
- HTTPS spoofing
- Wifi eavesdropping
- System hacking (OS attacked)  crawling, WhoIs look-ups, search engines, trace-routing, DNS look ups, harvesting emails/ subdomains
- Password cracking/ password attacks
