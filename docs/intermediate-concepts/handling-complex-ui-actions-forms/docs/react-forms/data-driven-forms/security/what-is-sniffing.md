Sniffing attacks refer to data thefts caused by capturing network traffic through packet sniffers that can unlawfully access and read the data which is not encrypted. The data packets are captured when they flow through a computer network.

The packet sniffers are the devices or media used to do this sniffing attack and capture the network data packets. They are called network protocol analyzers. Unless the packets are encrypted with strong network security, hackers will be able to steal and access the data. There are different packet sniffers such as Wireshark, Dsniff, Etherpeek, etc.

There are various types of sniffing
LAN Sniff – The sniffer attacks the internal LAN and scans the entire IP gaining access to live hosts, open ports, server inventory, etc. A port-specific vulnerability attack happens in LAN sniffing.
Protocol Sniff – The sniffer attacks occur based on the network protocol used. Different protocols such as ICMP, UDP, Telnet, PPP, DNS, etc., or other protocols might be used.
ARP Sniff – ARP Poisoning attacks or packet spoofing attacks occur based on the data captured to create a map of IP addresses and associated MAC addresses.
TCP Session stealing – TCP session stealing is used to monitor and acquire traffic details between the source & destination IP address. All details such as port number, service type, TCP sequence numbers, data are stolen by the hackers.
Application-level sniffing – Applications running on the server are attacked to plan an application-specific attack.
Web password sniffing – HTTP sessions created by users are stolen by sniffers to get the user ID, password, and other sensitive information.
