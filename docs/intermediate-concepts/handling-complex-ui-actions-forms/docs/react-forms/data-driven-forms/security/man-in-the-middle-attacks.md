Man in the Middle attack (MITM attack) is a type of attack where a site or person collects your or your organizationâ€™s data for malicious reasons. Usually, such malicious reasons are inclined toward finance fraud.

With the growth of cyberthreat technologies, other parties impersonate popular sites to gain your trust. After gaining your trust, they eventually access your data.

In this attack, usually, your login credentials and card details, majorly credit card details, are targeted.
