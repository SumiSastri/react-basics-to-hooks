Net Ninja explains this very well in video 27: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiaFedx5cfA&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ij8CfkAY2RAGb-tmkNwQHG&index=27&ab_channel=TheNetNinja]

```props.history()``` is a method available with every component with a route-path. 
the ```withRouter()``` HoC can be used using the component as the param of the method ```withRouter(NavBar)```

A programmatic re-direct is useful to redirect to a 404 - page not found component.

See ```programmatic-redirects.md``` for more information on the history object
