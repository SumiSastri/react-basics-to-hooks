Testing: Why failure is important

How do we maintain a constant state? We can only do this by assess risks-rewards. Therefore we are mainly checking all failure points. And in a test suite we are looking for every way that a feature can fail. Then we look at the acceptable failure rate and fix the highest risk-highest impact first and work our way to the lowest risk and lowest impact reducing the frequency of risk therefore maintaining a constant state as much as possible.

Checks the ability of an app to fail

- How does it fail ?
- Where does it fail ?
- How often does it fail ?
- How do we handle the failure ?
- Is the fail small enough to ignore?
- How do we define the failure rate?
- How do we prioritise fails to fix first -> on risk-impact to constant state ?
- How long will it take ?
- What is the cost of success? Is it better to fail? This determines acceptable tech debt
