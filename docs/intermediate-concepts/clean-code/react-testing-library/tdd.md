(TDD) Test-driven development is a style of programming in which testing, coding, and design are tightly interwoven. In test-driven development, instead of coming up with a detailed plan for a project, then following this plan, you start with the tests. Instead of building something and then testing that it works, we're going to write a test first, then write the code to pass that test.
