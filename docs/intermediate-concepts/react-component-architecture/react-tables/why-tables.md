Tables in an app help to display large amounts of data in an easy-to-view format. Tables can be created in HTML and with markdown and vanilla JS (see `table-structure.md`).

However tables, or grids as they are sometimes known as, are difficult to create. To deal with the complexity of building tables check the repo  [https://github.com/SumiSastri/react-tables] which uses React Tables a library of methods and custom hooks that make creating tables so much easier.

React Tables is a data-grid library that simplifies the creation of tables in an app. The reasons we would use this rather than vanilla react is:

- Libraries, in general, are really useful to minimise the time and effort creating the tables
- React-tables is a lightweight/ composable and easily extensible library for projects using React as the base component library
- The mark-up (CSS) is not supplied meaning it is a table-utility rather than a reusable component
- It is built on hooks

- Key features
- Basic Tables
- Headers/ Footers
- Sorting/ Filtering/ Paginations
- Select rows
- Columns - ordering/ hiding/ sticky columns
