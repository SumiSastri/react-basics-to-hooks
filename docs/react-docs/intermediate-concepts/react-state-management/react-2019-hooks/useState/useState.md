The ```useState()``` method is a Hook, introduced in React 2018. In React 2016- the class component defined state in a constructor and state was updated by the ```setState()``` method.

The ```useState()``` hook returns an array of 2 elements - the state object (getter) & the update state function (setter).

The getter and setter are 2 elements of a destructured array assigned to a variable and assigned to the ```useState()``` hook.

The ```useState()``` method returns initialState as its argument - ```useState(initialState)```.

Hooks are similar to mixins or modules. It hooks this functional component to State.
