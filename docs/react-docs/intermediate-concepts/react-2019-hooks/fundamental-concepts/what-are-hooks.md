### What are Hooks?

Hooks allow you to access state and all the React life-cycle methods in functional components. There is no need to use class components for hooks, they only work with functional components. They are direct API's to access React methods in the library.

Hooks are methods in the React Component Library that have been written converting data into arrays and uses array destructuring to access state and the life-cycle methods in the React Component Library.

Some best practices:

- Only call Hooks at the top level of the component
- Can not be used in iterations, conditional statements or nested functions.
- It is not a regular JavaScript function, it is a method of the React Component Library so needs to be written within the functional component code block.
