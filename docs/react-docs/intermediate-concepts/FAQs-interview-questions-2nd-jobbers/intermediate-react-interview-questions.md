# React interview questions - get to the next level after your first job

The purpose of this document is to provide a summary/ cheat-sheet of this section's documents. They are handy if you are preparing interviews when you are ready to move from your first job to your second job specialising with the React Component Library.

The key reasons why developers move into a second job is legacy code. Many small-medium and large organisations have not updated their legacy React-2016 code base to React-2019 using Hooks. Often senior developers get to working on Hooks rather than junior developers.

You may want to learn how to improve state-management with state-management tools and the second job or a promotion within your own company depends on you improving your knowledge and understanding of the React eco-system - state-management tools, becoming more autonomous in debugging your own code, understanding data-flows better so that you can pass data from one component to another understanding more complex patterns such as `prop-drilling`, `tree-thrashing`, `run-time vs compile-time` errors.

This section is dedicated to making it easy to level-up your basic React skills. Each of these questions has detailed sub-sections this is purely to summarize the key concepts and work as an interview revision cheat-sheat.

The best way to double check all these details are to follow the React documentation [https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html]

**Why do you like React are you familiar with other frameworks Angular/ Vue (what are the similarities-differences)?**

**Why is React just JavaScript under the hood?**

**What ES6 functions are best applied in React?**

**What is asynchronous JavaScript - how does it translate to asynchronous React?**

**How do you debug your React code - what tools do you use**

**What is prop-drilling how can it be effectively managed**

**What is state-management what are the ways in which state can be managed in React**

**What are controlled vs uncontrolled components - when would you use one over the other?**

**What is the `renderProps()` pattern?**

**What is the React eco-system - what other libraries have you used - what is your opinion on these libraries (advantages-disadvantages)?**

**How are you testing your React components - what is your view on unit vs. end2end tests?**

**What best practices do you follow writing clean code?**
