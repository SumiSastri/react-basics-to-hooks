Server-side rendering use a server to render the application in a local host.

Server rendered react applications trade complexity for performance, more tooling, technical know how and code to write are all factors.

But as a result, the client sees the relevant data to them much faster, even if they have a very slow device.

Server rendered applications first send a simple HTML package. The client, then later, the client gets the majority of the code. The client can see the application but is only able to interact with it after the majority of the code has been loaded.

CRA - create-react-app is a pre-bundled package that allows for server-side rendering of a react-app.
