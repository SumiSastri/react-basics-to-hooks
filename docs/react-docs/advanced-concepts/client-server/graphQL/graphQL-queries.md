Queries are used to query data in a database.

The query operation is composed of:

Fields - specific fields required by the front-end data-layer
Arguments -
Alias - if there are arguements with the same name, you need to create an alias to avoid errors
Fragments - reusable units (similar to functions - build sets of fields that you can use in mutliple queries) notated with 3 dots like the spread operator in JavaScript
Operation Name - unique name for the query keyword is `query` this is an anonymous query, you can also have unique named queries
Variables - similar to functions with input arguments
