**What is destructuring?**

It is a JavaScript concept used for both objects and arrays. In React you can destructure props and state as they are both objects.

With React 2019, arrays are destructured to hold state information.

Destructuring in React is unpacking the components properties into single elements so that they can be passed down in a shorted version to the child components - whether they are objects as in React-2016 or arrays as in React-2019.
