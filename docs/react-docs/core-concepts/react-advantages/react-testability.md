Plural Sight: React the Big Picture : Cory House

**Quick easy test writing with functional components making ui-components more robust**

- Comprehensive UI testing is traditionally hard as it is a hassle to configure, often needing a browser to test performace, is slow and brittle, time consuming to set-up/ write/ maintain
- React automated testing is made easy - CRA has a testing framework already integrated and it builds and spins up a FE so you can see changes instantly, tests can be written per component and therefore are less brittle, additional JavaScript testing libraries like Jest and Enzyme can be easily used instead of the React testing library if preferred. Or even Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Functional components have less side effects making them easy to test reliably and deterministically
- Test scripts are easy and quick to run
- Snapshot tests unearth trivial changes
