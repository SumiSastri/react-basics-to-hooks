- Each test should be independent of the others.
  -Any behavior should be specified in only one test.
- Don't test anything that you don't need to test, so no unnecessary assertions.
- Test only one code unit at a time.
- Avoid unnecessary preconditions.
- If your test relies on something else happening or on another test running first in order to succeed, then you need to refactor that test. O
- Make the test pass - You can figure out how to make it better later on.
- Triangulation - you should only generalize code when you have two examples or more of the test failing
- Refactoring - Here's where you make it right, remove duplication, and improve your test. It's very common during refactoring to come up with other ideas for how to improve your application.
- Rinse and repeat
