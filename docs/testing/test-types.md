- manual testing (a visual check that the feature works as intended)
- unit tests (each unit is tested with a variety of testing libraries depending on the language and the application) done in isolation. Each component being tested in isolation is a classic example.
- integration testing goes one step further to check not just one component isolation but 2 or more components on the same page.
  See Net Ninja video on the topic: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wbnwsKrnYU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gm4_-5UsNmLqMosM-dzuvQ&index=11]
- end-to-end testing ( the whole journey of the feature from front end ui-ux) - routing/ navigation from one page to another in the app as well as back-end API calls CRUD routes
- stress-testing - sometimes for security - white hat hacks to test a component's robustness
- smoke-testing
- test-coverage - making sure 100 percent of the code written is covered with appropriate tests
