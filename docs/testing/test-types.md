- manual testing (a visual check that the feature works as intended)
- unit tests (each unit is tested with a variety of testing libraries depending on the language and the application) done in isolation. Each component being tested in isolation is a classic example.
- end-to-end testing ( the whole journey of the feature from front end ui-ux) - routing/ navigation from one page to another in the app - so components in combination with each other rather than in isolation
- inegration testing goes one step further to check front-end ui-ux works with back-end integration with dbs
- stress-testing - sometimes for security - white hat hacks to test a component's robustness
- smoke-testing
- test-coverage - making sure 100 percent of the code written is covered with appropriate tests
