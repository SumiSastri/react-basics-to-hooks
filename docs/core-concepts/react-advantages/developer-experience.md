Plural Sight: React the Big Picture : Cory House

**Developer Experience improved/ simplified with CRA**

- Create an app in seconds with the pre-compiled CRA - create-react-app
- Rapid feedback
- Small logical API -simple API that's easy to learn
- Easy to learn if you know JavaScript - syntax is JavaScript no new syntax to learn. React encourages you to get better at JavaScript, and in doing so, you also get better at React.
- Few concepts to master
- Import the library with a Node import statement
- Create a function that returns JSX -> which looks like HTML (see also the folder `what-is-jsx` )
- JSX compiles back to JavaScript
- The function takes an argument which is an object
- The variables of this object are called props or properties (not params)
  (See functional component demo)
- You can also declare a React component using a standard JavaScript class (traditional react/ not Hooks)
- The component then renders these props using JSX (that looks like HTML)
- JSX compiles down to JavaScript with CRA (the create-react-app package), `React.createElement()` creates this HTML-like element - an object that specifies the attributes you'd like to set, and finally, the markup that should sit inside
- Debugging is easy with the debugging tool installed by the CRA
- Code Sandbox - easy to experiment with React and share work
