Many popular open source JavaScript projects are community driven. React is backed and actively maintained by Facebook. This means that React is driven by Facebook's needs. React's license initially had a patent clause which it revoked using MIT making it open-source. On the flip side Facebook provides React a fullâ€‘time development staff that carefully plans releases, writes documentation and blog posts, and provides ongoing support for issues.
