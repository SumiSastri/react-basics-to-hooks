#### Project goals

In this project, I explore the documentation of React and React Hooks. It is one in a series of tutorials where I work on the documentation and tutorial projects to apply the knowledge from the documentation and set into context.

#### Folder structure

There are 4 folders in this project each with their own readme to document what I have learnt.

1. [Breaking Bad](https://github.com/SumiSastri/react-basics-to-hooks/tree/master/breaking-bad)
   Project following You Tube Brad Traversy's tutorial to experiment with Hooks

2. [Fundamentals](https://github.com/SumiSastri/react-basics-to-hooks/tree/master/fundamentals)
   Tutorials on the fundamentals of React, follows the basic and intermediate documentation with examples and code snippets. This has a front-end which demos many concepts and has a brief explaination of how the code works. There are readme's in each section to drill down into the documentation and simplify it. There is a mini-project on the Context-API following a tutorial from NetNinja as I found the concepts a bit dry in the documentation, the project helped me understand how the documentation could be applied to a real o project.

3. [Hooks](https://github.com/SumiSastri/react-basics-to-hooks/tree/master/hooks)

Work in Progress: Tutorials on the fundamentals of Hooks, follows the basic and intermediate documentation with examples and code snippets.

3. [Progressive-Web-Apps]()

A fully deployed app on Netifly, following a Linked-In course.
